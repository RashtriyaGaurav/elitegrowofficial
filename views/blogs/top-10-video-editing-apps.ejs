  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Every editor has its strengths. Personally, I use <strong>CapCut</strong> because it’s free, lightweight, and works even on low-spec devices. For beginners, <strong>InShot</strong> is a great starting point. If you’re a medium-level editor, <strong>VN</strong> provides more advanced tools while still being approachable. Ultimately, the best app depends on your editing style, device, and the level of control you want. Try a few and see which fits you best!
